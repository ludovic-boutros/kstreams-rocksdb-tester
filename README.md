# kstreams-rocksdb-tester

This application is a Kafka Streams RocksDB test tool.
It is under construction :)

# TODO:

- Add description.
- Don't use reflection anymore and duplicate TestDriver code instead.
- Add a Docker build.
- Add a Docker Compose with monitoring (prometheus/grafana for instance).
